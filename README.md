# TextAnalysisHomework

This is the result of the first homework on Text Analysis class. 
The objective is learning about different representation methods of documents as well as distance metrics to analyse the similarity between a pair of documents. 

Requeriments:

- Use at least 10 documents for the analysis
- Use at least 2 representation methods of documents
- Use at least 2 distance metrics

For this homework, I created 10 text documents based on the introduction text on the following Wikipedia pages:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog

The resulting text files are inside the folder "rawData".

Two different distance metrics were used to analyse the similarities between the documents.
